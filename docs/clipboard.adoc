. Start a new session, for example with ID `f2bcd32b-d932-4cdc-a639-687ab8e4f840`.
. To get clipboard value send the following HTTP request:
+
```
$ curl http://selenoid-host.example.com:4444/clipboard/f2bcd32b-d932-4cdc-a639-687ab8e4f840

some-clipboard-value
```
. To update clipboard value:
+
```
$ curl -X POST --data 'some-clipboard-value' http://selenoid-host.example.com:4444/clipboard/f2bcd32b-d932-4cdc-a639-687ab8e4f840
```
