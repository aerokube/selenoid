== Browser Images
We maintain a set of prebuilt Docker container images for different browsers including:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/firefox/[Firefox]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/chrome/[Google Chrome]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/opera/[Opera]

All these images are free to use. See image tags for a list of supported versions. Build files are stored in http://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-images[selenoid-images] repository.
Feel free to create issues or request images for new versions.

[NOTE]
====
. Complete list of browser images can be found in <<Browser Image information>>
. These images support all UTF-8 locales. This can be important if you want to save files using national alphabet symbols. You can enable your preferred locale in browsers configuration file by setting respective environment variables:
```
{
    "chrome": {
        "default": "64.0",
        "versions": {
            "64.0": {
                "image": "selenoid/vnc:chrome_64.0",
                //...
                "env" : ["LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8", "LANGUAGE=ru:en", "LC_ALL=ru_RU.UTF-8"]
            }
        }
    }
}
