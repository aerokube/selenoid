== Browser Images
We maintain a set of prebuilt Docker container images for different browsers including:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/firefox/[Firefox]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/chrome/[Google Chrome]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/opera/[Opera]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/selenoid/phantomjs/[PhantomJS]

All these images are free to use. See image tags for a list of supported versions. Build files are stored in http://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-images[selenoid-images] repository.
Feel free to create issues or request images for new versions.

NOTE: Complete list of browser images can be found in <<Browser Image information>>
