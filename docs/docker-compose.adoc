== Selenoid with Docker Compose

To avoid network problems between browser drivers inside containers and Selenoid when using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] for combining with another services (such as UI or ggr) you need to enable *bridge* network mode for all services:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3'
networks:
  selenoid:
services:
  selenoid:
    networks:
      elk: null
    image: aerokube/selenoid:latest-release
    volumes:
      - "$PWD:/etc/selenoid"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
      - "$PWD:/opt/selenoid/video"
      - "$PWD:/opt/selenoid/logs"
    environment:
      - OVERRIDE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR=$PWD
    command: ["-conf", "/etc/selenoid/browsers.json", "-video-output-dir", "/opt/selenoid/video", "-video-output-dir", "/opt/selenoid/logs", "-container-network", "selenoid"]        
    ports:
      - "4444:4444"
