== Recommended Docker Settings

* We recommend to use modern Docker storage drivers like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs[AUFS] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS[OverfayFS]. Never use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper[Device Mapper] - it is very slow. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/[this] page on how to adjust Docker storage driver. To check your currently used driver type:
+
```
# docker info | grep Storage
```
* Total number of simultaneously running containers (adjusted via ```-limit``` flag) depends on your host machine hardware. Our experience shows that depending on your tests the recommended limit is something like: ```1.5-2.0 x numCores```, where ```numCores``` is total number of cores on your host machine.
