== Live Browser Screen

Selenoid supports showing browser screen during test execution. This works with containers having https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing[VNC] server installed. To see browser screen:

. Pass ```enableVNC``` capability in tests:
+
```
enableVNC = true
```
. Launch http://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui[Selenoid UI] to see the screen.

This works by proxying VNC port from started container to ```http://localhost:4444/vnc/<session-id>``` where ```<session-id>``` is Selenium session ID.
