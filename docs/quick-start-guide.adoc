=== Start Selenoid
==== Option 1: you have a workstation, virtual machine or server

. Make sure you have recent https://www.docker.com/[Docker] version installed.
. Download http://aerokube.com/cm/latest/[Configuration Manager] (Selenoid quick installation binary) for your platform from https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases/latest[releases] page.
. On Linux or Mac give execution permissions to binary:

    $ chmod +x cm

==== Option 2: you have DigitalOcean or Google Cloud

We deliver ready to use images with Selenoid and Selenoid UI. Take a look at <<Cloud Platforms>> section for more details.

=== Run Your Tests

. Run your tests against Selenoid like you do with regular Selenium hub:
+
.Tests Endpoint
----
http://localhost:4444/wd/hub

+
If something does not work, you can easily check that Selenoid is running with opening *status* url:
+
.Current Selenoid Status
----
http://localhost:4444/status
----
+
A successful request should return a JSON with browser usage statistics.

. To open Selenoid UI navigate to the following page in your browser:
+
.UI Default URL
