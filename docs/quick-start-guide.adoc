== Quick Start Guide

[TIP]
====
The fastest way to start is http://aerokube.com/cm/latest/[Configuration Manager], which can be downloaded
from https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases/latest[releases] page. This tool will do all preparations automatically.
Please refer to corresponding http://aerokube.com/cm/latest/[Quick Start with Configuration Manager] section.

So all the content of this page can be simplified to only:

----
./cm selenoid start
----

This guide will show how to start Selenoid manually.
====

WARNING: This Guide assumes you already know how to deal with command line and Docker in case of docker commands.
Please take a look to CM first in any case.

=== Prepare

- Create `config/browsers.json` configuration file with content:

.config/browsers.json
[source,javascript]
----
{
    "firefox": {
        "default": "57.0",
        "versions": {
            "57.0": {
                "image": "selenoid/vnc:firefox_57.0",
                "port": "4444",
                "path": "/wd/hub"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

- Pull browser docker image with `docker pull selenoid/vnc:firefox_57.0`.

=== Run binary

- Download binary for your operating system from https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid/releases/latest[releases] page
and save it as `selenoid` (or `selenoid.exe` on windows).

NOTE: Add execution permission in case of *nix os-type with `chmod +x selenoid`.

- Then run:

.*nix
----
./selenoid
----

.Windows
----
selenoid.exe
----

It should write to console something like:

----
2017/11/26 21:23:43 Loading configuration files...
2017/11/26 21:23:43 Loaded configuration from [config/browsers.json]

...

2017/11/26 21:23:43 Listening on :4444
----

=== Run selenoid with docker

If you have https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker] installed you can omit downloading binary and run it inside of container.
Prepare config, pull browser image, then run:

.*nix
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -d                                   \
--name selenoid                                 \
-p 4444:4444                                    \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock    \
-v `pwd`/config/:/etc/selenoid/:ro              \
aerokube/selenoid:latest-release
----

.Windows PowerShell
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
> $current = $PWD -replace "\\", "/" -replace "C", "c"  <1>
> docker run -d                                         `
--name selenoid                                         `
-p 4444:4444                                            `
-v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock           `
-v ${current}/config/:/etc/selenoid/:ro                 `
aerokube/selenoid:latest-release
----
<1> Simple macros to get $PWD with compatible form assumed your directory located on `C:` drive


=== Use it for tests

Run your tests against Selenoid like you do with regular Selenium hub:

.Tests endpoint
----
http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
----

Selenoid was created to be run in big Selenium clusters and thus has no built-in user interface.
This is why trying to open an URL above in browser returns *404* and this is the expected behavior.
If something does not work, you can easily check that Selenoid is running with opening *status* url:

.Current selenoid status
----
http://localhost:4444/status
----

A successful request should return a JSON with browser usage statistics.
. You can additionally use http://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui[Selenoid UI] to see browser screen or consumption statistics.
The simplest way is to download and run its binary from https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui/releases[releases] page and start it:

----
./selenoid-ui
----

See http://aerokube.com/selenoid-ui/latest/[UI documentation] for more installation options.
By default UI is listening on port 8080. To start using it open the following page in your browser:

.UI default page with separate binary
----
http://localhost:8080/
----
