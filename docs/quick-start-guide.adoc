== Quick Start Guide
. Make sure you have https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker] installed
. Download browser images and generate configuration file:
+
```
$ mkdir -p /etc/selenoid
$ docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aerokube/cm:1.0.0 selenoid --last-versions 2 --tmpfs 128 --pull > /etc/selenoid/browsers.json
```
. Start Selenoid:
+
```
# docker run -d --name selenoid -p 4444:4444 -v /etc/selenoid:/etc/selenoid:ro -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aerokube/selenoid:1.1.1
```
. Run your tests against Selenoid like you do with regular Selenium hub:
+
```
http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
```

NOTE: Selenoid was created to be run in big Selenium clusters and thus has no built-in user interface. This is why trying to open an URL above in browser returns *404* and this is the expected behavior. The good news are - there is a standalone user interface. Refer to <<User Interface>> section for more details.
