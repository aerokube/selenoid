=== Run Your Tests

. Run your tests against Selenoid like you do with regular Selenium hub:
+
.Tests Endpoint
----
http://localhost:4444/wd/hub

If something does not work, you can easily check that Selenoid is running with opening *status* url:
+
.Current Selenoid Status
----
http://localhost:4444/status
----
+
A successful request should return a JSON with browser usage statistics.

. To open Selenoid UI navigate to the following page in your browser:
