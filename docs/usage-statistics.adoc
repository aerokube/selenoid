== Usage Statistics

Selenoid calculates usage statistics that can be accessed with HTTP request:

.Request
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:4444/status
----

.Result
[source,javascript]
----
{
    "total": 80,
    "used": 10,
    "queued": 0,
    "pending": 1,
    "browsers": {
      "firefox": {
        "46.0": {
          "user1": {
            "count":1,
            "sessions":[
                {
                    "id": "a7a2b801-21db-4dae-a99b-4cbc0b81de96",
                    "vnc": false,
                    "screen": "1920x1080x24"
                 }
            ]
          },
          "user2": {
            "count":6,
            "sessions":[
                //...
            ]
          },
        },
        "48.0": {
          "user2": {
            "count":3,
            "sessions":[
                //...
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
}

Users are extracted from basic HTTP authentication headers.

=== What Statistics Mean
A typical session lifecycle looks like the following:


.Typical Session Lifecycle
image:img/lifecycle.png[lifecycle]

. A new session request arrives to Selenoid.
. Selenoid `-limit` flag specifies how many sessions can be created simultaneously. It is shown as `total` in statistics. When requests reach the limit - subsequent requests are placed in queue. `Queued` requests just block and continue to wait.
. When there is a free slot for request Selenoid decides whether a Docker container or standalone driver process should be created. All requests during startup are marked as `pending`. Before proceeding to next step Selenoid waits for required port to be open. This is done by sending HEAD requests to the port.
. When a container or driver is started (ping is successful) Selenoid does a new session request just in the same way as standard Selenium client.
. Depending on what is returned as response on the previous step session is marked as `created` or `failed`. Created and running sessions are also included to `used` value.
. When a session is created Selenoid just proxies the rest of session requests to the same container or driver.
. New session request can fail because of Selenium errors or issues with container \ driver startup. In that case an error is returned to user. 

=== Sending Statistics to External Systems

To send Selenoid statistics described in previous section you can use https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf[Telegraf]. For example to send status to https://github.com/graphite-project[Graphite]:

. Pull latest Telegraf Docker container:
+
```
# docker pull telegraf:alpine
```
. Generate configuration file:
+
[source,bash]
----
# mkdir -p /etc/telegraf
# docker run --rm telegraf:alpine   \
    --input-filter httpjson         \
    --output-filter graphite config > /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
----

. Edit file like the following:
+

[source,go]
----
[agent]
interval = "10s" <1>

[[outputs.graphite]]
servers = ["my-graphite-host.example.com:2024"] <2>
prefix = "one_min" <3>
template = "host.measurement.field"

[[inputs.httpjson]]
name = "selenoid"
servers = [
"http://localhost:4444/status" <4>
]
----
<1> adjust interval if needed
<2> adjust host and port
<3> something before hostname, can be blank
<4> this is localhost only if Telegraf is run on Selenoid host

. Start Telegraf container:
+
[source,bash]
----
# docker run --net host -d  \
    --name telegraf         \
    -v /etc/telegraf:/etc   \
    telegraf:alpine --config /etc/telegraf.conf
----

+
Metrics will be sent to _my-graphite-host.example.com:2024_. Metric names will be like the following:
+
```
one_min.selenoid_example_com.httpjson_selenoid.pending
one_min.selenoid_example_com.httpjson_selenoid.queued
one_min.selenoid_example_com.httpjson_selenoid.total
```
