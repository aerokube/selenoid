== Uploading Files To S3

IMPORTANT: This feature only becomes available when Selenoid is compiled with `s3` build tag (missing by default).

Selenoid can upload recorded video and log files for every running session to S3-compatible storage.

To enable this feature you need to specify S3 access information as follows:

    $ ./selenoid -s3-endpoint https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com -s3-region us-east-2 -s3-bucket-name my-bucket -s3-access-key <your-access-key> -s3-secret-key <your-secret-key>

NOTE: If you omit `-s3-access-key` and `-s3-secret-key` flags then environment variables and shared credentials file are automatically tried as a fallback. 

By default uploaded file name is preserved, i.e. S3 path is `/<session-id>.log` or `/myCustomVideo.mp4`. You can optionally provide your custom key pattern using `-s3-key-pattern` flag and a set of placeholders:

.S3 Key Placeholders
|===
| Placeholder | Meaning 

| $browserName | Replaced by Selenium browser name capability value
| $browserVersion | Replaced by Selenium browser version capability value
| $date | Replaced by current date, e.g. `2018-11-01`
| $fileName | Replaced by source file name 
| $fileExtension | Replaced by source file extension 
| $fileType | Replaced by `log` for log files and `video` for video files
| $platformName | Replaced by Selenium platform capability value
| $quota | Replaced by quota name (usually coming from Ggr)
| $sessionId | Replaced by Selenium session ID
|===

For example, when launching Selenoid with `-s3-key-pattern $browserName/$sessionId/log.txt` files will be accessible as `firefox/0ee0b48b-e29b-6749-b4f1-2277b8f8d6c5/log.txt`. You can also override key pattern for every session with `s3KeyPattern` capability.

Sometimes you may want to upload only video files or files matching some complicated pattern or to not upload some files. To achieve this use `-s3-include-files` and `-s3-exclude-files` flags. These flags accept https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)[globs] such as `*.mp4`.
